    **ArcticDB** is a high performance, serverless **DataFrame database** built for
    the Python Data Science ecosystem. Launched in March 2023, it is the successor
    to [Arctic](https://github.com/man-group/arctic).
    ArcticDB offers an intuitive Python-centric API enabling you to read and write
    Pandas DataFrames to S3 or LMDB utilising a fast C++ data-processing and
    compression engine.
